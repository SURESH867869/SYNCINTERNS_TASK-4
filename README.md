The Electricity System Building project is a collaborative effort using VS Code, Java, and HTML to design and simulate an efficient electricity distribution system. Leveraging the versatility of VS Code's integrated development environment, Java serves as the backend language for implementing the core functionality of the system. HTML is utilized for the user interface, providing an intuitive and interactive platform for users to visualize and manage the electricity system components. Through this project, users can create, modify, and optimize electricity networks, monitor power flow, and analyze system performance. The seamless integration of these technologies facilitates a comprehensive solution for building and managing complex electricity infrastructures.
